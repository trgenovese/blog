One of the chief problems that I faced during the first year of my Ph.D. program was when I remembered that I read something really cool but forgot where I had read it. Taking inspiration from [Kevin Baker’s](https://twitter.com/kevinbaker) [Weekly Reading](http://www.irregularexpressions.org) posts and [Nikki Steven’s](https://twitter.com/drnikki) [Open Source Ph.D.](http://drnikki.github.io), I’ve decided that every month I will post a list of everything I have read—along with a photograph I have taken. Here’s this month; the dawn of my second year.
