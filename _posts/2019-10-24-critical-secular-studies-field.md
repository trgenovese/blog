## Major Field 2: Religion, Science, and Critical Secular Studies

This field attends to the historical processes whereby conceptual binaries get established and mobilized toward (i) the formation of “secularization” as a modern philosophy of history, (ii) the “secular” as a modern epistemic domain, and (iii) “secularity” as a modern political doctrine. It thus also attends to (iv) the role of the social and human sciences in the production and reproduction of these processes, and the question of how they might (re)constitute the project of critique in relation to them.

This field also aims to identify, in a connected fashion, (v) the social dynamics in Europe and its colonies, which brought about a distinction between “religion” and “science” as a presumed “natural kind,” in order to problematize the social labor and institutional formation that both drive and have been driven by this imagined bifurcation. It pays close attention to (vi) the catalytic work done by notions and processes of disenchantment in these dynamics.

With pragmatic intent, the field will be organized around three prominent trajectories of critical work in the recent history of the interpretive human sciences, including and especially anthropology. All three bear directly in the problem at the center of this field, and to the methodological and ethical question of anthropology’s relation to these developments. These trajectories have only recently been brought into closer conversation. One goal of this field is thus to decipher their potential interrelations:

1. The critical genealogy of the West, and the rise of critical secular studies—disenchantment and the question of secularization. 
2. Post-Weberian critiques of symbolic anthropology and the ontological dualism implied in a presumed split between “meaning-making” humans and ostensibly “non-symbolic” realities beyond the human—disenchantment and the question of empiricism.
3. Decoloniality and the politics of re-enchantment, including the proposed re-enchantment of materiality and buffering of older modes of materialist critique—disenchantment and the question of power. 

In the spirit of case-based inquiry, this field will give attention to how these developments intersect with current scholarship on Soviet culture, Russian Cosmism, and cosmonautics.
