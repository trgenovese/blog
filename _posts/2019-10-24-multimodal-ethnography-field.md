## Minor Field: Multimodal Ethnography

While the two major fields (“Political Anthropology” and “Religion, Science, and Critical Secular Studies”) focus on *theoretical engagements* with the anthropology of science, technology, and religion, this minor field concentrates on an emerging *ethnographic method*. Multimodal ethnography—materializing from visual ethnographic methods—evokes the heterogeneities of anthropological research across multiple platforms and collaborative sites, including film, photography, soundscapes, dialogue, performance, installations, social media, kinesis, and practice.

While recognizing that ethnographic methods have always incorporated a certain level of multimodal approaches, this field aims to (i) trace the historic genealogy of multimodality and political ethnography within the landscape of so-called “postcolonial anthropology,” (ii) grapple with the ways in which multimodality interfaces with ethnography as a (set of) technique(s), and (iii) further conceptualize my own (modest) contributions to multimodal ethnography by way of “ethnographic texture” (Genovese 2018; Powis 2019, personal communication) and “gonzo ethnography/phronetics” (Genovese 2019).

This field is centered on a tripartite organization of multimodality and its relationship to the history, technique, and future of ethnography as an anthropological method: 

1. A micro-genealogy around the politics of ethnography focusing on the legacy of postcolonial and symbolic anthropology in trying to answer the question of how ethnographic methods are complicit within our own disciplinal history and in what ways are we attempting to supersede our inherent coloniality—multimodality and the politics of truth.
2. The ways in which multimodality is mobilized in ethnographic research and how empiricism re-emerges or is re-contextualized within the process—multimodality and ethnographic technique.
3. Focusing on how the development of *affectively tactile* photography, *sonically immersive* soundscapes, and *gonzo phronetic* performance can lead to the blurring of normative emic/etic practices in ethnographic research. The ethnographic subject can become ruptured or occluded as a result of the fabrication of empirical fidelity through a re-contextualization process, thereby providing small previously concealed cues about the communities and spaces ethnographers and interlocutors inhabit—multimodality and the conceptualization of ethnographic texture & gonzo ethnography.
