My article "Going Gonzo: Toward a Performative Practice in Multimodal Ethnography" has been assigned an issue in the journal *entanglements* and is [available for free from the journal](https://entanglementsjournal.org/going-gonzo/).

The HTML version seems to have images and captions cropped, so reading the [PDF copy](https://trgenovese.github.io/pubs/Genovese_GoingGonzo.pdf) is recommended.
