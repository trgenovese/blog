My article "'Death is a disease': Cryopreservation, neoliberalism, and temporal commodification in the U.S." has been assigned an issue in the journal *Technology in Society* and is [available for free from the journal](https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1XXUI,3f~s4pmv) for the next 60 days, after which it will go behind a paywall.

A [PDF copy](https://trgenovese.github.io/pubs/Genovese_DeathIsADisease.pdf) is also permanently available on my website.

I managed to incorporate my favorite film—Darren Aronofsky's *The Fountain*—into this article so one of my academic goals is already fulfilled.
