Just wanted to share the latest episode of [Deathnography](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7dCBFUlDbKbriLqloXMBSD?si=FDquqYyeSBy7XZBGU-UE_w) (or listen below) in which I am one of the guests. Listen to me stutter and bumble my way through talking about being a communist, working in neoliberal universities, Using Marx Todayâ„¢, critical utopianism, Cosmism, and more! 

Check it out!
