My good friend and colleague [Courtney Cecale](http://www.courtneycecale.com) and I organized a panel for this year's American Anthropological Association annual meeting and it has been accepted for programming. It will be on Thursday, November 15th and will feature some amazing papers!

To read the panel and individual paper abstracts, check out the panel's website [here](https://extremeanthropologies.carrd.co).
